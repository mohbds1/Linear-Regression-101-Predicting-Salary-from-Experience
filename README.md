## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

This repository contains a **simple, beginner-friendly Linear Regression project** to predict employee salaries based on years of experience. Itâ€™s designed as an **introductory example for anyone learning Machine Learning in Python**.  

We demonstrate how to:  
- Load and explore a small dataset  
- Visualize the relationship between **Years of Experience** and **Salary**  
- Build and train a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`  
- Evaluate the model using **MAE, RMSE, and RÂ²**  
- Interpret model coefficients in plain language

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes:  

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| YearsExperience | Number of years an employee has worked |
| Salary | Employee salary in USD |

> **Note:** The dataset is small (30 rows), perfect for learning and experimentation.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction.git
cd salary-prediction
````

###  Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
```

###  Run the notebook

Open `Salary_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells sequentially.


I can also **add screenshots/plots from the notebook** to make it even more appealing for GitHub â€” do you want me to do that?
